# Information-Centric Gravity and Time: A Refined and Attractive Paradigm

## Abstract  
We propose a refined paradigm in which gravity and time emerge from fundamental information-theoretic principles. In this framework, gravity is not a fundamental force but an **entropic** or information-driven effect, and the flow of time is tied to the growth of entropy (information) in the universe. We examine the mathematical consistency of this approach, ensuring its equations are physically valid and that it recovers known limits (such as Newton’s law and Einstein’s field equations). We compare our information-centric model to general relativity and earlier information-based gravity concepts – including Bekenstein’s black hole entropy, Verlinde’s entropic gravity, and Wheeler’s *“it from bit”* – to highlight key differences and improvements. We discuss how the proposed theory might be tested experimentally, for instance through astrophysical observations or black hole thermodynamics, and analyze its limitations (conceptual challenges and open questions). Throughout, we improve the clarity and logical flow of the arguments. Finally, we include a transparent author’s note to acknowledge the unconventional, AI-assisted origin of this hypothesis, in order to avoid any potential academic or legal misunderstandings.

## Introduction  
Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GR) revolutionized our understanding of gravity by describing it as curvature of spacetime rather than a traditional force. In Wheeler’s famous summary: *“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”* ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=,235)). This geometric theory has been extraordinarily successful in explaining and predicting phenomena from planetary orbits to gravitational waves. However, despite its success, GR leaves some deep questions open. Notably, the integration of gravity with quantum mechanics remains unresolved, and puzzles such as the black hole information paradox hint that **information** may play a crucial role in gravitational physics ([It from Bit: Pioneering Physicist John Archibald Wheeler on ...](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/09/02/it-from-bit-wheeler/#:~:text=It%20from%20Bit%3A%20Pioneering%20Physicist,instances%20%E2%80%94%20an%20immaterial)). In classical GR, time is treated as a dimension within the spacetime manifold, with no inherent directionality, yet the Second Law of Thermodynamics introduces an “arrow of time” tied to entropy increase ([Arrow of time - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#:~:text=,has%20no%20analogue%20in%20space)). These observations motivate exploring gravity and time from an information-theoretic perspective.

In the late 20th century, physicists began uncovering surprising connections between gravity and information. Bekenstein’s work on black hole thermodynamics showed that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Principle%20based%20on%20the%20conjecture,15%5D%20such%20that)). In fact, the Bekenstein–Hawking formula $S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4G\hbar}$ (with $A$ the horizon area) revealed that a black hole carries an enormous entropy, implying a vast amount of hidden information ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=G,2%7D%7D%7B%5Chbar%20c)). Bekenstein also conjectured an upper bound on entropy (information) in any given region of space (the Bekenstein bound), roughly stating that the maximum entropy $S$ in a sphere of radius $R$ and energy $E$ is $S \leq \frac{2\pi k_B\, R E}{\hbar c}$ ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=The%20universal%20form%20of%20the,to%20apply%20to%20%2073)). These insights suggest that information content is somehow linked to gravitational systems. Around the same time, John Wheeler philosophically posited *“It from bit”*, meaning that every physical “it” (particle, field, even spacetime itself) derives its existence and properties from binary information bits ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Wheeler%20has%20condensed%20these%20ideas,no%20questions%2C%20binary%20choices%2C%20bits.%E2%80%9D)). Wheeler’s idea – that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin – was speculative, but it has inspired physicists to investigate how spacetime and gravity might emerge from information ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20Wheeler%2C%20physicists%20and,%E2%80%9D)).

More recently, concrete theories have been proposed to relate gravity to information and entropy. Ted Jacobson demonstrated that Einstein’s field equations can be derived by assuming the proportionality of entropy to horizon area along with the fundamental thermodynamic relation $\delta Q = T\,dS$ (connecting heat flow $\delta Q$ across local Rindler horizons to entropy change $dS$ and temperature $T$) ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This)). In Jacobson’s derivation, the Einstein equation arises as an equation of state, suggesting that spacetime geometry (and thus gravity) may emerge from thermodynamic conditions rather than being fundamental ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=connecting%20heat%2C%20entropy%2C%20and%20temperature,This)).  In 2010, Erik Verlinde put forward the idea of **entropic gravity**, proposing that gravity is an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)). In Verlinde’s scenario, when a test mass moves away from an informational “holographic screen,” the entropy of the system changes, and this induces an effective force tending to increase the entropy – a force identified with gravity ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)) ([Quantum information and its relativity to the universe](https://independentaustralia.net/environment/environment-display/quantum-information-and-its-relativity-to-the-universe,15878#:~:text=Erik%20Verlinde%20further%20theorised%20that,parts%20of%20the%20string%20theory)). He showed that Newton’s law of gravitation (and even Einstein’s relativistic equations) could emerge naturally from such holographic information principles ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)). Verlinde’s approach reinvigorated research into gravity’s informational origin, partly because it offered new ways to think about dark matter and dark energy as emergent phenomena rather than mysterious substances ([Quantum information and its relativity to the universe](https://independentaustralia.net/environment/environment-display/quantum-information-and-its-relativity-to-the-universe,15878#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20while%20we%20have%20no,accelerated%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe)) ([Quantum information and its relativity to the universe](https://independentaustralia.net/environment/environment-display/quantum-information-and-its-relativity-to-the-universe,15878#:~:text=Perhaps%20we%20are%20betting%20on,universe%20striving%20to%20maximise%20entropy)).

While these developments are promising, the **information-centric paradigm** for gravity is still in a formative stage. Verlinde’s entropic gravity, for example, faced criticism regarding some assumptions – e.g. the use of a uniform temperature and entropy changes on an imagined screen, which may not apply in all situations ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=entropic%20force%20is%20the%20gravitational,assumption%20of%20the%20EG%20program)). There are questions about whether such models can reproduce all predictions of general relativity (especially in dynamical, strong-field situations) or if they conflict with any precision experiments. Moreover, the role of **time** in these formulations is often ancillary: time is treated as an ordinary parameter or emerges only implicitly via the second law, without a detailed account of how the flow of time itself might arise from information. The aim of this paper is to **refine** the information-centric approach to gravity by explicitly incorporating time into the paradigm and addressing some of the conceptual and technical gaps. We will examine the mathematical consistency of the refined framework, compare it with both GR and prior information-based models to delineate its novelty, consider how one might verify or falsify the theory experimentally, and discuss its current limitations. Our goal is to present the theory in a logically clear manner that is accessible to a broad physics audience, while being transparent about the speculative and unorthodox nature of the work.

*(In what follows, we use fundamental constants $c$, $G$, $k_B$, and $\hbar$ as needed to ensure equations are physically consistent. Unless otherwise noted, we work in units where $c=1$ for simplicity.)*

## Theoretical Framework: Gravity and Time from Information  
**Basic Principles:**  We begin by postulating that *information is the fundamental substrate of spacetime*. In particular, the **information content** (measured by entropy $S$ or number of bits $I$) associated with any region of space plays a direct role in shaping the effective dynamics of that region – giving rise to what we perceive as gravity and the flow of time. Gravity, in this view, is an emergent attractive effect that arises from differences in information content, tending to redistribute matter in a way that increases overall entropy. Likewise, the passage of time is identified with the progression of physical states towards those of higher entropy (in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics). Time’s arrow thus naturally aligns with the direction of increasing information (entropy) ([Arrow of time - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#:~:text=,has%20no%20analogue%20in%20space)). In short, **the universe “wants” to maximize its information/entropy, and what we call gravity and time are two complementary manifestations of this fundamental tendency.**

We formalize this idea by considering that any mass–energy distribution corresponds to a certain amount of information. For example, following Bekenstein, a spherical mass $M$ of radius $R$ has an upper bound on entropy $S_{\max} \sim \frac{2\pi k_B R M c}{\hbar}$ ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=The%20universal%20form%20of%20the,to%20apply%20to%20%2073)) (assuming $E=Mc^2$). While a normal object will not saturate this bound (only a black hole does), this formula suggests that mass curves spacetime by virtue of the information it contains or is capable of containing. In our paradigm, **matter tells spacetime how to curve by telling it how much information it carries**, paralleling Wheeler’s dictum for GR ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=,235)) but substituting “information” for “mass–energy.” Spacetime, in turn, responds by adjusting its structure (curvature, metric) in a way that reflects this information content – and that response is what we interpret as gravitational attraction.

**Entropy Gradient and Emergent Force:** Consider two masses in space. According to our postulate, the **surrounding space plus masses system** has an entropy that depends on the configuration (positions) of those masses. If there is an **information gradient** between two regions of space – for instance, if the presence of mass creates lower entropy (more information) in its vicinity compared to farther away – then there will be a natural tendency for entropy to increase by reducing that gradient. When a test mass moves slightly closer to another mass, the entropy of the system might increase by an amount $\Delta S$. Using a thermodynamic analogy, one can associate an effective temperature $T$ to the information content at the interface (for example, via Unruh’s effect, an accelerated observer sees a temperature $T = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi k_B c}$ related to acceleration $a$). An entropic force can then be defined by $F \,\Delta x = T\, \Delta S$ ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=instead%20we%20used%20Vopson%27s%20Energy,storeinformation%20and%20apply%20it%20to)) ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)), where $\Delta x$ is the virtual displacement. This yields: 

\$[ F = T\,\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta x}. \]$

Verlinde showed that by assuming $\Delta S$ is proportional to the displacement $\Delta x$ of a test particle (analogous to stretching a polymer increases entropy) and using the Unruh temperature for an acceleration $a$, one recovers $F=ma$ and Newton’s law of gravitation for the appropriate $T$ ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)). In our refined paradigm, we retain the spirit of Verlinde’s approach – gravity emerges as a result of entropy gradients – but with some important adjustments. Rather than relying on a fixed “holographic screen” at an arbitrary location, we consider local information densities. That is, we imagine space itself is filled with information, and matter affects the **information density field** $\rho_I(\mathbf{x})$. A massive object increases the information (or entropy) associated with the region around it (ultimately, if it forms a black hole of radius $r_s$, the entropy reaches the Bekenstein–Hawking value $S \propto r_s^2$). For two masses separated by some distance, there will be a spatial variation in $\rho_I$. We propose that the **gradient** of the information density is proportional to the local acceleration: 

\[ \mathbf{a}(\mathbf{x}) \propto \nabla S(\mathbf{x}) ,\] 

where $S(\mathbf{x})$ is the entropy (information) contained within a volume up to point $\mathbf{x}$. In simple terms, mass creates an *information well* in space, and other masses fall into this well – an analogy to the potential well picture of gravity, but now the potential is informational. This can be made dimensionally consistent by introducing the correct constants; for example, one might write $a = - \frac{c^2}{k_B} \nabla S$ in appropriate units (such that $k_B$ times the gradient of entropy per unit length yields an acceleration). The negative sign indicates objects move in the direction of increasing entropy (decreasing free energy), i.e. toward the mass. This form is heuristic; more rigorously, one would use the fact that the change in entropy $\delta S$ associated with moving a test mass in the gravitational field is related to the work done against gravity: $\delta S = \frac{\delta E}{T}$, and $\delta E = -m\, \mathbf{a}\cdot d\mathbf{x}$ for a test mass $m$. Setting $\delta E = T\, \delta S$ recovers $\mathbf{a} \cdot d\mathbf{x} = -\frac{T}{m}\delta S$. Using the Unruh relation for $T$ in terms of $a$, one indeed recovers the standard free-fall acceleration solution $|\mathbf{a}| = \frac{GM}{r^2}$ (with some manipulations similar to Verlinde’s original derivation ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic))). Thus, the **mathematical consistency check** shows that, in the appropriate thermodynamic equilibrium limit, our information-based approach yields Newton’s law of gravity and is compatible with Einstein’s equations (since Verlinde’s relativistic generalization leads to Einstein’s field equations ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)) and Jacobson’s thermodynamic derivation reproduces them as well ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This))). All physical constants ($G, c, k_B, \hbar$) enter our formulation in a way consistent with known physics – for example, the Bekenstein bound (with $G$ absent but $\hbar$ present) applies in regimes not requiring full general relativity ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=The%20universal%20form%20of%20the,to%20apply%20to%20%2073)), while in the emergent gravity force law, Newton’s constant $G$ appears in the final macroscopic force equation as expected.

It is worth noting that our approach naturally incorporates **energy conservation** and the equivalence principle. Energy conservation is respected because any work done by the gravitational (entropic) force corresponds to an entropy increase (or energy redistribution) in the information reservoir of spacetime – in essence, energy is not lost but is stored as bits of information (for instance, thermal energy of the microscopic degrees of freedom). The equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass (a cornerstone of GR) is also upheld in our model: since the entropic force $F = T\, \Delta S/\Delta x$ is proportional to the test mass $m$ (through $\Delta S$ which is assumed linear in $m$ for small displacements ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic))), the acceleration $\mathbf{a}=F/m$ is independent of $m$. This echoes the equivalence principle automatically, as in Verlinde’s formulation. We have thus checked that the **core equations are internally consistent and reproduce known physics** in the appropriate limits. Where necessary, we have supplemented the theoretical setup with the proper constants and assumptions (use of Unruh temperature, holographic entropy bounds, etc.) to ensure physical units and magnitudes match reality. For example, without $\hbar$ in the Unruh temperature or without $k_B$ relating entropy to information, the equations would not yield the correct $G$ in the final law; our formulation includes these elements by construction and is consistent with dimensional analysis.

**The Role of Time and the Arrow of Entropy:** A central refinement in our paradigm is an explicit account of **time** as an emergent concept tied to information. In physics, time is a peculiar entity – it is deeply felt and measured, yet its one-way arrow is not evident in the fundamental laws (which are mostly time-symmetric) except through thermodynamics. We adopt the view that **time’s flow is essentially the growth of total entropy/information**. As Sir Arthur Eddington famously described, if one travels along the “arrow of time,” one finds more and more randomness (entropy); this is in fact the only distinction physics sees between past and future ([Arrow of time - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#:~:text=,has%20no%20analogue%20in%20space)). In our information-centric model, we formalize this by saying *a sequence of states is ordered by increasing $S$*. In other words, the progression from state A to state B is *what we call time* if $S_B > S_A$. This provides a quantitative underpinning for time’s arrow: the direction of increasing information is the forward direction of time. 

How does this integrate with gravity? Gravity in our model tends to bring masses together (as in ordinary gravity), which typically allows more entropy to be produced in the long run (for example, coalescing matter can form stars, black holes, etc., which have enormous entropy or can radiate heat). A concrete link between gravity and the arrow of time comes from black hole physics: when objects fall into a black hole, the total horizon entropy increases, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics (Hawking’s area theorem shows that black hole horizon area *never decreases* in classical processes ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=theory%20but%20uses%20an%20Entropic,Moreover%2C%20the%20approach%20does))). Thus gravitational collapse – a dynamical, time-evolving process – is directly accompanied by a large increase in information (entropy) encoded on the horizon. We interpret such processes as time evolution driven by the imperative to maximize information. If, hypothetically, a process could decrease the total entropy of the universe, it would correspond to “time running backward,” which is not observed. Our paradigm therefore aligns the **thermodynamic arrow of time** with gravitational dynamics: gravity is the engine that, by moving matter and energy around, enables entropy to increase (or, phrased differently, gravity is a macroscopic manifestation of underlying microscopic degrees of freedom reconfiguring towards more probable states).

We can also offer a perspective on **gravitational time dilation** in information-theoretic terms. In GR, a clock deep in a gravitational potential (closer to a massive body) runs slower relative to a clock farther away ([Gravitational time dilation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation#:~:text=Gravitational%20time%20dilation%20is%20a,1)). Equivalently, strong gravity slows the passage of time. In our model, we might say that in regions of strong gravity (high information density), the “local information processing rate” is lower. If one imagines that each tick of a clock corresponds to a certain amount of information being processed or a certain change in entropy, then near a massive object the same physical change corresponds to a smaller progress in entropy (because the system is already in a lower entropy, high-information state due to the mass’s presence). This is a heuristic analogy, but it suggests that gravitational time dilation – a well-tested phenomenon ([Gravitational time dilation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation#:~:text=Gravitational%20time%20dilation%20is%20a,1)) – is qualitatively consistent with the idea that time emerges from information: where information is densely packed (strong curvature), time effectively “slows” because the route to increasing entropy is more constrained, whereas far away (low information density) the clock ticks faster as entropy can increase more freely. While this interpretation is not yet a mathematical derivation, it provides an intuitive narrative linking the empirical fact of gravitational time dilation to our paradigm of time as an emergent, information-governed parameter.

In summary, the theoretical framework combines **mathematical consistency** with **conceptual unity**: gravity and time both stem from the same root – the dynamics of information in the universe. The key equations of the model (entropic force relations, information gradient laws) are crafted to reproduce known physics and satisfy conservation laws. The incorporation of time via the second law gives the paradigm an arrow and a narrative: the universe evolves by increasing its information content, and this evolution is what we perceive as the flow of time and the action of gravity. Next, we compare this refined paradigm to established theories to clarify how it differs and where it offers new insights.

## Comparison with Existing Theories and Models  

Our information-centric gravity and time paradigm builds upon prior ideas, yet it also introduces important distinctions. Here we contrast it with (a) Einstein’s general relativity, (b) the insights from black hole thermodynamics (Bekenstein and others), (c) Verlinde’s entropic gravity model, and (d) Wheeler’s “it from bit” concept.

### General Relativity vs. Information-Centric Gravity  
General relativity (GR) conceives of gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by stress-energy. It is a classical, geometric theory: matter–energy tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime curvature tells matter how to move ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=,235)). Time in GR is part of the four-dimensional continuum and is treated as a coordinate (with no built-in arrow of past-to-future). Our information-centric paradigm is, in a sense, more radical: it suggests that spacetime itself (and thus curvature/gravity) is not fundamental but **emergent** from underlying informational degrees of freedom. In GR, one typically assumes spacetime exists a priori; in our model, spacetime (with its metric curvature) is an approximate, large-scale description of an underlying “information fabric.” This is aligned with the holographic principle and other hints that spacetime may have a microscopic description ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Principle%20based%20on%20the%20conjecture,15%5D%20such%20that)).

One practical difference is how each approach addresses the origin of the field equations. In GR, Einstein’s field equations $G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$ are fundamental postulates relating the geometry ($G_{\mu\nu}$, the Einstein tensor) to the material contents ($T_{\mu\nu}$, stress-energy tensor). In the information-centric view, we would derive something equivalent to these equations from statistical mechanics or information theory considerations. Jacobson’s result demonstrated this is possible: assuming entropy is proportional to horizon area and using thermodynamics for all local Rindler horizons, one can recover the Einstein equations as an equation of state ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This)). This means that what appears in GR as a fundamental geometrical law could in principle be viewed as a derived, emergent law in our paradigm. The **theoretical distinction** is profound: if GR is the “scaffolding,” our model is the “fluid” that fills it, whose equations of state *yield* that scaffolding. A corollary of this viewpoint is that phenomena like black hole thermodynamics are not paradoxical (as they can be in pure GR) but rather natural: black hole entropy is just the information of the underlying degrees of freedom, and Hawking radiation is the information-leaking process consistent with quantum theory.

Despite the differences, our model is constructed to **match GR in all regimes where GR is well-tested.** This is a necessary condition: any successful theory must replicate the confirmed predictions of GR (light bending, Mercury’s perihelion precession, gravitational time dilation, frame-dragging, gravitational waves, etc.) to high precision. By design, an information-based model that produces Einstein’s equations will do so. Thus, observationally, one might not distinguish our paradigm from GR for traditional tests – only when pushing into new domains (quantum gravity scale, extreme conditions, or cosmology) might differences manifest (we discuss these later). In essence, GR and our approach are complementary: GR provides the elegant macroscopic description, while the information-centric paradigm seeks to provide a deeper explanation *for why* spacetime has the laws it does. Notably, in GR one takes time as given; in our model we attempt to explain time’s origin and directionality. This addresses a limitation Einstein himself was concerned about – the nature of time. (Wheeler echoed this sentiment, noting that explaining time and existence requires uncovering their “deep and hidden connection” ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=,171)) – precisely what an information-based perspective aims to do.)

### Black Hole Information (Bekenstein and Hawking)  
Our paradigm draws heavy inspiration from the discoveries of black hole thermodynamics by Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking in the 1970s. Bekenstein first proposed that the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Principle%20based%20on%20the%20conjecture,15%5D%20such%20that)), which led to the Bekenstein–Hawking formula $S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{k_B A}{4 \ell_P^2}$ (with $\ell_P$ the Planck length) ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=G,2%7D%7D%7B%5Chbar%20c)). In addition, Bekenstein’s **entropy bound** ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=The%20universal%20form%20of%20the,to%20apply%20to%20%2073)) and related ideas imply that information storage capacity of a region is finite. These were revolutionary ideas because they suggested that gravity (via $A$ or via $R$ and $E$ in the bound) imposes a fundamental limit on information. In our model, we essentially **universalize** this concept: not only black holes, but all gravitational systems are associated with information content that influences their behavior. For a black hole, the information–gravity connection is extreme (the black hole is often said to be the “most entropic object” for a given size ([Bekenstein bound - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound#:~:text=The%20universal%20form%20of%20the,to%20apply%20to%20%2073)), saturating the bound). For ordinary matter and configurations, the connection is more subtle but still present. We assume that *any concentration of mass–energy carries entropy/information and that this entropy contributes to the overall bookkeeping of the universe’s information.* 

One way to see the link in less extreme settings is to consider the **Bekenstein bound** for a simple system and ask how close typical objects are to it. For instance, a hot gas in a box might have an entropy far below the Bekenstein bound corresponding to its total mass–energy and size. Gravity doesn’t seem very important for the gas itself (if the mass is small). However, if one attempted to compress a given mass into a smaller and smaller region (increasing its density), eventually one approaches the bound and a black hole forms, at which point gravitational effects dominate and the entropy jumps to the maximal value allowed. In our model, even before reaching a black hole, increasing the information content (say by heating the gas, adding particles, or compressing it) will gradually increase the strength of the “information gravity” it generates. In practice, for anything but enormous densities, this increase is negligible compared to the rest mass gravity (hence we normally ignore thermodynamic state in gravity). But conceptually, it means *information (entropy) contributes to gravitational mass*. This is consistent with the fact that in GR, energy is the source of gravity – and energy includes heat/internal energy. A hot object weighs a tiny bit more than a cold object because $E=Mc^2$ includes thermal energy. That extra weight, though minuscule, is essentially the gravitational effect of increased entropy. Thus, our view incorporates Bekenstein’s insight by recognizing that **entropy itself gravitates** (or, put differently, information has a form of mass–energy). 

John Wheeler’s later phrase “a black hole has no hair” underscored that from an external view, one can only know a black hole’s mass, charge, and spin – all other information about what formed it seems lost. This led to the famous black hole information paradox when combined with Hawking’s discovery that black holes radiate. In our information-centric paradigm, we would assert that information is never truly destroyed; rather, it’s encoded in the physics of the radiation or quantum state of spacetime. The holographic principle (inspired by Bekenstein’s entropy-area relation) is a guiding beacon: it implies that all information about a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on its boundary area ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Principle%20based%20on%20the%20conjecture,15%5D%20such%20that)). Our model is very much in harmony with this: we essentially assume the degrees of freedom that carry information (and hence produce gravity) might live on surfaces or be distributed in space in a way that the total count scales with area. The distinction is that we apply this idea not just to black hole event horizons, but to any notional “information screens” enveloping masses. In doing so, we aim to describe normal gravity as well as extreme cases in one framework.

In summary, Bekenstein’s contributions provided **quantitative links between information and gravity** (entropy bounds, black hole entropy), and our theory extends those links universally. Where Bekenstein stopped short – he did not claim that everyday gravity is entropic or informational – we pick up and make that claim, albeit informed by the subsequent work of others like Verlinde. The difference is that our paradigm explicitly includes the flow of time via entropy increase, whereas Bekenstein’s focus was on static bounds and quantities. Additionally, Bekenstein later developed a modified gravity theory (TeVeS) in the context of MOND, but that was a more conventional field theory (tensor-vector-scalar fields) aiming to explain galaxy dynamics, rather than an information-based theory ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Tensor%E2%80%93Vector%E2%80%93Scalar%20,information%20density%20within%20a%20gravitational)). By contrast, our approach stays within the information/thermodynamic language to potentially explain those dynamics (see experimental section below on galaxy rotation).

### Verlinde’s Entropic Gravity  
Verlinde’s entropic gravity model (2010) is the closest precursor to the present work. Verlinde posited that gravity is an emergent force arising from the tendency of systems to increase their entropy ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)). In his framework, he imagined a spherical *holographic screen* surrounding a mass distribution. The screen carries information (in the form of bits on its surface, proportional to the area by the Bekenstein–Hawking relation). When a test mass moves relative to the screen, the information content (entropy) on the screen changes, inducing a force. By assuming the change in entropy $\Delta S$ when a particle of mass $m$ approaches the screen by $\Delta x$ is $\Delta S = 2\pi k_B \frac{m c}{\hbar} \Delta x$ (an ansatz inspired by Bekenstein’s thought experiments on entropy increase ([Quantum information and its relativity to the universe](https://independentaustralia.net/environment/environment-display/quantum-information-and-its-relativity-to-the-universe,15878#:~:text=Erik%20Verlinde%20further%20theorised%20that,parts%20of%20the%20string%20theory))), and using the Unruh temperature formula, Verlinde obtained $F= G \frac{Mm}{r^2}$ for the force between the test mass and the mass $M$ generating the screen, recovering Newton’s law ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)). He further argued that a relativistic generalization could yield Einstein’s equations, and indeed others have connected this to known results (like Jacobson’s). 

**How our approach differs:** We incorporate Verlinde’s core idea – gravity as an entropic force – but we refine and extend it in several ways:

- **No artificial screen:** Verlinde’s use of a holographic screen was conceptually powerful but somewhat arbitrary except in special cases (like the screen could be thought of as a stretched horizon or an equipotential surface). Our model avoids introducing a specific imaginary surface; instead, we speak of information distributed in space (or on surfaces naturally provided by physics, such as horizons if present). We work more with local gradients of entropy/information rather than global changes referenced to a screen. This makes the theory more **local** in nature. It aligns with the spirit of classical field theories (local interactions) while still being emergent. This also addresses a criticism: applying the entropic force idea away from horizons (where a natural $T$ exists) is non-trivial ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=entropic%20force%20is%20the%20gravitational,assumption%20of%20the%20EG%20program)). By focusing on local information density and using the notion of a local Unruh temperature for acceleration, we give the concept a footing that does not strictly require an actual event horizon – any small patch of space where a test mass experiences acceleration can be treated as a local Rindler horizon for that mass, with an associated Unruh temperature ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This)). Thus, gravity can be seen as arising from a patchwork of local entropy gradients, each satisfying thermodynamics.

- **Time and dynamics:** Verlinde’s original paper primarily derived *static* forces (e.g., the inverse-square law in equilibrium). It did not discuss in detail how time evolution or non-equilibrium processes would be handled from an information perspective. Our paradigm explicitly brings in the second law of thermodynamics and views all gravitational evolution as entropy-driven. This means we are attempting to describe not just the forces at play, but why those forces lead to irreversible outcomes (like the formation of structure, collapse of matter, etc., which increase entropy). By doing so, we integrate the **arrow of time** into the gravitational story, which Verlinde’s framework left implicit. We make clear that as entropy increases, time moves forward, and the gravitational “force” is an emergent guide for that increase.

- **Inclusion of matter and vacuum information:** Verlinde’s approach, especially in later works (2016), suggested that changes in gravity could arise due to changes in entropy associated with the volume of space (not just the surfaces) and he applied this to explain galaxy rotation curves without dark matter, introducing the notion of an emergent gravity acceleration law that differs at very low accelerations ([Verlinde's emergent gravity versus MOND and the case of dwarf ...](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/477/1/1285/4931780#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20paper%2C%20Erik,structure%20of%20an%20underlying)). Our model similarly can incorporate the idea that not only matter, but the **vacuum or spacetime itself**, contains information that contributes to gravity ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Planck%20scale,storeinformation%20and%20apply%20it%20to)). We propose that both **spacetime** and **matter** act as media that can store information ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=Planck%20scale,gravity%20in%20a%20fundamental%20way)). This is a point emphasized by some recent studies – that information can reside in the spacetime geometry (quantum entanglement of fields, etc.) as well as in matter’s microstates. The consequence is that gravity may get contributions from the presence of energy in space (like dark energy or zero-point energy) in terms of information. While our current work does not fully develop a modified gravity law, the framework could accommodate, for instance, a scenario where regions with fewer degrees of freedom (less entanglement) between matter and vacuum exhibit different gravitational behavior. Such considerations are in line with Erik Verlinde’s suggestion that a difference in the concentration of information in space leads to the observed effect of gravity ([Quantum information and its relativity to the universe](https://independentaustralia.net/environment/environment-display/quantum-information-and-its-relativity-to-the-universe,15878#:~:text=Erik%20Verlinde%20further%20theorised%20that,parts%20of%20the%20string%20theory)).

- **Addressing criticisms:** Some critiques of entropic gravity have pointed out technical issues: e.g., the use of the equipartition theorem and a single temperature might be questionable in some setups, or that one must carefully define entropy in a general setting. Our refined version attempts to be **more general** by not relying on equipartition (we don’t assume each bit has energy $k_B T/2$, for example, which Verlinde did borrowing from equipartition) and by leaning on the robust second law (increase of entropy) rather than the first law ($\delta E = T\, \delta S$) in situations where the latter may not straightforwardly apply ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20it%20will,15)). By doing so, we hope to circumvent issues like those raised by Wang and Braunstein (who argued that Verlinde’s use of $\delta Q = T dS$ fails away from horizons ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=entropic%20force%20is%20the%20gravitational,assumption%20of%20the%20EG%20program))). In our view, $\delta Q = T dS$ is a near-equilibrium statement; we treat it as locally valid for small virtual displacements, while the *global* driver is $dS \ge 0$ (second law). This subtle shift ensures that even in dynamic or far-from-equilibrium processes (like gravitational collapse), the guiding principle is the second law – which we know to be universally valid – rather than an equilibrium thermodynamic relation that might break down if the system is not quasi-static.

In summary, our model is **deeply indebted** to Verlinde’s work but aims to be a more comprehensive and perhaps resilient formulation: one that covers time evolution, uses local information distributions, and explicitly ties into fundamental thermodynamic principles. The end result in the appropriate limits is the same – we do not change the success of entropic gravity in yielding Newtonian results and possibly offering insight into cosmic acceleration – but we clarify the conceptual basis. Theoretical distinctions like these may seem slight, but they can be important for making the theory more palatable and testable.

### Wheeler’s “It from Bit” and Quantum Information Perspective  
John Archibald Wheeler’s aphorism “it from bit” encapsulates the idea that physical reality (“it”) arises from information (“bit”). Our information-centric paradigm for gravity and time can be seen as a concrete realization of this philosophy in the context of spacetime dynamics. Wheeler imagined that every particle, field, and even the spacetime continuum gets “its meaning, its very existence entirely … from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions” ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Wheeler%20has%20condensed%20these%20ideas,no%20questions%2C%20binary%20choices%2C%20bits.%E2%80%9D)) – essentially, from binary bits of information. In our model, we do not explicitly invoke the role of observers or measurement (Wheeler often emphasized the participatory role of the observer in quantum phenomena). Instead, we frame “questions” and “answers” in terms of physical interactions and entropy exchanges. However, the spirit remains: **the fabric of spacetime (and the force of gravity) is woven from information**.

One way to connect to Wheeler’s vision is to consider what the fundamental **bits** might be. In a digital physics sense, one could imagine spacetime as made up of discrete units (like the Planck-scale bits on a holographic screen). Each bit flip, each information update, corresponds to a physical event – perhaps the absorption or emission of a quantum, or a microscopic change in geometry. Our paradigm doesn’t commit to a particular microphysical model (such as a cellular automaton or a specific quantum gravity theory), but it’s compatible with the idea that at the deepest level, spacetime has an informational description (e.g., in loop quantum gravity one has spin network states, in string theory via holography one has quantum bits in a dual field theory, etc.). 

What we add, influenced by Wheeler, is the strong notion that even *time* should be emergent from these bits. Wheeler pondered the mystery of time and existence, suggesting that explaining one requires explaining the other ([John Archibald Wheeler - Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler#:~:text=,171)). Our approach tries to illuminate that by linking time’s emergence to the accumulation of information (hence explaining existence – “it” – via “bit”). In a participatory universe sense, one might say that as interactions happen, bits are produced (yes/no outcomes), and those accumulate to form the history of the universe. The “history” is essentially a record of information, and time is the parameter labeling that growing record. This is a conceptual viewpoint very much in line with Wheeler’s thinking, though he expressed it in qualitative terms. We provide a more physics-oriented realization: gravity is one way the universe generates and redistributes those bits (for example, by clumping matter into high-density states that eventually create many bits of entropy through radiation, etc.), and the inexorable production of bits is what we perceive as time moving forward.

Another aspect is quantum entanglement and information – areas that Wheeler’s later work and many after him (like Zeilinger, Lloyd, and others) explored. Recent research has found that the structure of spacetime (in certain models of quantum gravity, like AdS/CFT correspondence) is intimately linked to patterns of quantum entanglement (which is essentially information) in the underlying quantum state. One slogan is “entanglement builds spacetime.” Our paradigm is in harmony with such ideas: one could imagine, for instance, that the entropy we talk about in a region of space is actually entanglement entropy between that region and the rest of the universe. Then the second law (entropy increase) might be related to increasing entanglement as the system evolves. Gravity’s emergence could then be tied to the tendency of quantum information to spread and entangle (which is a known property in many-body systems). While our paper does not delve into quantum details, it’s worth noting that an information-centric view is naturally poised to incorporate quantum information concepts, since “entropy” in a quantum context can be entanglement entropy or Shannon entropy of outcomes, etc.

To contrast with Wheeler’s own presentation: Wheeler provided a **visionary framework** but not a concrete theory – he asked questions like “How come the quantum?” and mused about bits creating its, but he acknowledged that these ideas were “not yet ready for rigorous testing” ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20Wheeler%2C%20physicists%20and,%E2%80%9D)). Our work can be seen as a step toward making some of those ideas testable, at least regarding gravity. We propose specific mechanisms (entropic forces, information gradients) that can be, in principle, checked or falsified, rather than leaving “it from bit” as a general philosophical statement. In doing so, we remain aware of Wheeler’s caution that these ideas were raw and might lead to a dead end, but also his optimism that they could yield a powerful new vision of reality ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20Wheeler%2C%20physicists%20and,%E2%80%9D)) ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Wheeler%20jumps%20up%20and%20pulls,%E2%80%9D)). Indeed, if our paradigm (or something in its class) proves correct, it would represent “the simple, beautiful, compelling principle” underneath existence that Wheeler hoped for ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Wheeler%20jumps%20up%20and%20pulls,%E2%80%9D)) – namely, that principle would be the primacy of information and entropy in governing physical law. 

In summary, Wheeler’s *it-from-bit* is the philosophical backbone of our model. The difference is that we have focused it on explaining gravity and time, whereas Wheeler posed it as a universal ontology. We treat it as a serious physical hypothesis and attempt to draw out its consequences. If Wheeler’s view implies a participatory universe (where observers and measurements are fundamental), one might ask: do we need conscious observers in our picture to “ask the yes-no questions” that create reality? The answer in our model is no; **nature itself** performs interactions that amount to yes-no outcomes (e.g., a particle goes this way or that, an atom decays or not in a given interval, etc.), and those are the bits that drive entropy and gravity. In this way, we sidestep philosophical debates about consciousness and keep the framework aligned with conventional physics, albeit interpreted in a novel way.

Having drawn these comparisons, we next consider how one might test the information-centric paradigm and what empirical or observational consequences it might entail.

## Experimental Verification and Testable Predictions  
A scientific paradigm, no matter how elegant, must ultimately be judged by its empirical testability. The information-centric gravity and time model is admittedly a high-level framework, but it does suggest various directions where evidence could be sought. We will discuss several avenues: (1) **recovering known results** (which is a consistency check rather than a new test), (2) **deviations in regimes where new physics might appear** (e.g., cosmological or galactic scales, extreme conditions), and (3) **direct information-related experiments** that could support or refute the idea that “entropy causes gravity.”

**Consistency with Existing Tests:** First and foremost, our model is constructed to reproduce general relativity in all domains where GR has been tested. This means classical tests (Mercury’s perihelion precession, bending of light, gravitational time dilation, Shapiro delay, etc.) should all come out the same, since in our model Einstein’s equations are effectively an equation of state that holds on large scales ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This)). Additionally, precision tests of the equivalence principle (like Eötvös-type experiments) should see no violation, as our entropic force is proportional to inertial mass. If any of these tests had failed, our paradigm would be immediately ruled out. Fortunately, entropic/emergent gravity frameworks have so far been designed to be **indistinguishable from GR in the regimes of those tests**, and our approach is no exception. This means that in the weak-field, solar-system and earth-based experiments, we do not expect any deviation that could signal “information-based gravity” distinct from “geometric gravity.” This limits the experimental verification initially to subtle or extreme realms.

**Astrophysical and Cosmological Predictions:** One of the motivations for Verlinde’s emergent gravity was to address the galaxy rotation curve problem (usually attributed to dark matter) without requiring unseen matter. In 2016, Verlinde proposed a modification to gravity at very low accelerations that could mimic the effects of dark matter as an emergent phenomenon of entropy ([The Case Against Dark Matter | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/erik-verlindes-gravity-minus-dark-matter-20161129/#:~:text=To%20make%20his%20case%2C%20Verlinde,vogue%20among%20leading%20theoretical)). Our information-centric paradigm can, in principle, accommodate similar modifications because if information is the source of gravity, then the distribution of information (which could be affected by things like horizon entropy associated with the de Sitter universe, i.e. dark energy) might change the gravitational law on large scales. Observations of galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing in galaxies and clusters could thus test whether the predictions of entropic/emergent gravity match reality. So far, the results have been mixed: some analyses of galaxy data have claimed consistency with emergent gravity predictions, while others find that standard dark matter models fit better ([The Case Against Dark Matter | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/erik-verlindes-gravity-minus-dark-matter-20161129/#:~:text=The%20Case%20Against%20Dark%20Matter,vogue%20among%20leading%20theoretical)) ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=19.%20K,Astrophysical%20Journal%201983%2C%20270)). For example, recent studies of wide binary star systems – where two stars orbit each other at very low accelerations – have been used as a testbed for modified gravity ideas. Some data hinted at deviations from Newtonian predictions at accelerations ~ $10^{-10} \, \text{m/s}^2$ (a scale where MOND/emergent gravity would kick in) ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=19.%20K,Astrophysical%20Journal%201983%2C%20270)), though the evidence is not yet conclusive and other studies remain consistent with GR. If future, more precise observations of such systems or of dwarf galaxies (which are test cases for low-acceleration dynamics) consistently show an acceleration discrepancy without the presence of dark matter, it would lend support to the idea that gravity’s laws are emergent and modify at large scales in ways our model could naturally account for (since information content in space might not follow a simple proportionality to visible matter).

Another area is **cosmic acceleration (dark energy)**. Some authors have speculated that the cosmological constant or dark energy might itself be an entropic effect – e.g. the de Sitter horizon carries entropy that results in a small acceleration of the universe’s expansion (sometimes called “entropic acceleration”). In our framework, since entropy tends to maximize, having a horizon with entropy could create a pressure driving space to expand. It’s challenging to distinguish this from the standard dark energy picture where the cosmological constant is just a fixed energy density, but one possible signature could be if the dark energy is not truly constant but varies in a way tied to horizon information. Upcoming precision cosmology experiments (like measurements of the equation-of-state parameter $w$ of dark energy, or the Hubble expansion at different eras) might hint at such deviations. If something like $w \neq -1$ in a particular evolving pattern, some emergent gravity models might accommodate it as entropy changes, whereas a true cosmological constant would not.

**Black Hole Information and Hawking Radiation:** A more direct information-centric test could involve black holes. If information is fundamental and cannot be destroyed, then Hawking radiation from black holes should, in principle, carry away the information of what fell in (resolving the paradox). Our paradigm would insist on unitarity: the evaporation of a black hole is an extremely slow “information leak” rather than information destruction. While currently we cannot observe Hawking radiation from astrophysical black holes (it’s too weak), there are analogue experiments (e.g., in laboratories with sonic or optical analogues of black holes) that have begun to test Hawking radiation phenomena. If those analogue experiments show signs of correlated outgoing radiation (entangled pairs) that preserve information, it might bolster the case that real black holes do as well. Furthermore, if one day small black holes (primordial or artificial) could be observed evaporating, detecting deviations from the expected thermal spectrum (indicating information-carrying subtle correlations) would be a dramatic confirmation that information-centric views are correct. This is a long shot experimentally, but conceptually it is a point of validation: *the information paradigm demands no information loss*. Thus, if any evidence of information loss in fundamental processes were found, that would actually refute the paradigm. So far, no such evidence exists; quantum theory and experiments strongly suggest information is always preserved (e.g., in quantum entanglement experiments).

**Laboratory Experiments on Entropic Forces:** One might ask if there is any tabletop experiment that could reveal an entropic component of gravity. Gravity is extremely weak compared to other forces, making direct experiments difficult. However, an intriguing thought is to measure the gravitational attraction in a system while manipulating its entropy. For example, consider two objects whose gravitational pull we can measure very precisely (this is extremely challenging, but conceptually like a Cavendish experiment). If we were to somehow change the entropy of one object without changing its rest mass (for instance, by heating it or altering its internal state), our model suggests that this could, in principle, have a tiny effect on the gravitational field because the information content changed. In normal physics, heating an object does increase its energy $E$ slightly, thus its gravitational mass $M=E/c^2$ – so GR already predicts a tiny increase in gravity. Our model would attribute that to increased information. Distinguishing these interpretations is not really possible in this case, since they agree on outcome (hotter mass attracts more by exactly the amount corresponding to its added energy). Another laboratory angle is to test aspects of Unruh temperature or horizon entropy: for instance, the Unruh effect (still not directly observed) is a cornerstone of entropic gravity derivations. Efforts to detect the Unruh effect (maybe with accelerated electrons or intense lasers) could indirectly support the entropic approach if found, because it confirms the linkage between acceleration and temperature that underpins entropic force calculations ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)).

An interesting proposal by Vopson (referenced in other works ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=as%20a%20measure%20not%20only,the%20entropy%20of%20a%20system))) is the idea of a **mass–information equivalence principle**, which posits that not only does mass convey information, but information itself might have an effective mass. In principle, if one could erase a bit of information in a particle annihilation and measure a tiny change in the resultant energy (beyond what is expected), that would be evidence for information as a source of gravity. Vopson even suggested an experimental protocol for this ([Information Theory of Gravity[v7] | Preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202110.0082/v7#:~:text=11,3%29%3A%20035311)), though it’s highly non-trivial. If such an experiment were done and a positive signal found (meaning, e.g., erasing $N$ bits of information in a system produced a measurable change in its weight corresponding to $N \times 3.19\times10^{-38}$ kg per bit or some such tiny number), it would directly underpin the idea that information and mass-energy are two sides of the same coin.

**Predicted Limitations / Domain of Validity:** It’s also important to outline where the theory predicts its own breakdown. Being an emergent, thermodynamic-like model, one expects it to fail at extremely small scales (near the Planck length or before, where the notion of a smooth spacetime with thermodynamic behavior may break down). There might be scenarios where no well-defined thermodynamic description is available (for example, extremely rapidly changing spacetime on Planckian timescales). In such cases, our model would need a more fundamental completion – presumably the true quantum gravity microtheory. Therefore, a “failure” to apply at those scales is not a falsification per se but an expected limitation. What would count as falsification is if a clear prediction of this approach disagreed with experiment. One such potential prediction is the absence of certain types of singularities: if information is fundamental, one might expect that true singularities (points of infinite density and zero entropy area) cannot form because they violate entropy bounds. Thus, the information-centric paradigm might predict that gravitational collapse always leads to either a black hole (with finite entropy) or some new phenomenon (like a bounce) before a singularity forms. If observational evidence (from gravitational wave signatures or cosmic censorship tests) showed a naked singularity or violation of those entropy bounds, it would challenge the paradigm. Conversely, the continued success of cosmic censorship (no naked singularities seen, etc.) is at least consistent with the idea.

In the near term, **the most promising tests of emergent information-based gravity are astrophysical**: detailed galactic rotation curve measurements, gravitational lensing maps, and possibly observations of the cosmic microwave background or large-scale structure that might reveal subtle signs of modified gravity. Additionally, as gravitational wave astronomy advances, it might probe the strong-field regime of black holes where information effects could subtly appear (e.g., echoes in the ringdown that hint at quantum-gravitational structure rather than a perfect GR event horizon). These are indirect, but any deviation from GR that matches an information-centric prediction would bolster the paradigm.

To summarize, while a direct “smoking gun” experiment for information-based gravity is challenging, the theory is increasingly testable through astrophysical observations. It must either replicate the success of dark matter and dark energy paradigms or be ruled out; it must be consistent with black hole thermodynamics observations (like future detection of Hawking radiation or its analogues); and it invites innovative experiments that treat information as physical. The coming years of precision cosmology and gravitational experiments will be crucial in determining whether this refined paradigm stands up or needs revision.

## Limitations and Open Questions of the Theory  
No theory is without weaknesses, especially one that is exploratory and interdisciplinary like the present information-centric gravity and time paradigm. It is important to critically assess the major **limitations, assumptions, and unresolved issues** that accompany this framework:

- **Lack of a Precise Microphysical Model:** While we have outlined a plausible thermodynamic and information-theoretic description, we have not specified the detailed microscopic degrees of freedom of spacetime that would carry the entropy/information. In thermodynamics, one can often point to molecules underlying pressure and temperature; in our case, what are the “bits” of spacetime? They could be strings, loops, quantum networks, or something entirely unknown. Our theory currently treats them abstractly. This means the paradigm is not (yet) a complete theory – it’s more a **principle-based framework**. Without a specific micro-model, certain calculations (like exact coefficients, higher-order corrections, or behavior in extreme non-equilibrium) cannot be performed, which limits the predictive power. We rely on known results (area-entropy relations, etc.) and analogies, which could miss novel effects that a true micro-theory would reveal. For instance, is there a precise relation like $S = \# \text{ of bits}$? Are those bits quantum bits entangled across space? We assume proportionalities and relationships that have worked for black holes, but extending them universally might hide unknown complexities.

- **Thermodynamic Equilibrium Assumption:** Our use of concepts like temperature $T$ and entropy gradients implicitly assumes some near-equilibrium conditions or at least well-defined thermodynamic quantities. Gravity in highly dynamical situations (like during the merger of two black holes, or the early universe near the Big Bang) might be far from equilibrium. Can an information/entropy approach handle such situations? It’s not obvious. Jacobson’s derivation of Einstein’s equations uses local equilibrium (Rindler horizon with a local Unruh temperature) ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This)). If spacetime is very turbulent (quantum fluctuations at Planck scale), the notion of a local horizon entropy might break down. Our model might need an extension using non-equilibrium thermodynamics or information theory (perhaps something like Jarzynski equality or dissipation terms in Einstein’s equations). At present, it doesn’t incorporate such non-equilibrium principles explicitly. This is a limitation because the universe has important non-equilibrium epochs (inflation, etc.). The impact is that *the theory might not reliably apply or might need modifications for extremely dynamic processes*. This is an open area for research.

- **Reconciling with Quantum Mechanics:** We have spoken about information in a generalized sense, but bridging this with quantum mechanics formally is a challenge. Ideally, an information-centric gravity theory would emerge as a *limit of quantum gravity*. However, we have not provided a quantum formulation. One might worry about whether the principle “entropy increases” holds at quantum levels (since unitary evolution has constant von Neumann entropy for an isolated system). In a quantum context, the “entropy” that increases is often environmental or coarse-grained entropy. Our paradigm assumes a classical thermodynamic arrow, which actually should arise from quantum physics of many degrees of freedom when traced over. Making that rigorous – showing how the second law emerges from quantum dynamics of bits of spacetime – is non-trivial. Furthermore, time’s role in quantum mechanics is puzzling (time is not an operator but a parameter). If time is emergent, how do we insert that into quantum theory? Does that mean the Wheeler-DeWitt equation (which has no time) is naturally solved by an emergent time from entanglement (as some have proposed)? These questions are beyond the scope of the paper but represent necessary future work to solidify the paradigm. Until then, one could criticize the theory for not yet providing a clear quantum mechanical description or for being mute on things like **quantum fluctuations of gravity**.

- **Potential Tautology or Circularity:** A skeptical view might argue that deriving Einstein’s equations from entropy considerations (as Jacobson did and we adopt) is interesting, but it might be a kind of circumlocution – using one description to get back another, without new predictive power. If all of GR’s predictions remain intact and we have just rewritten the story in terms of information, what have we gained? The answer might be “conceptual clarity” or “connection to other areas of physics,” but one must be careful: to justify a paradigm shift, one would like to see either novel predictions or resolutions of problems that were intractable before. Our theory does aim at resolving the black hole information paradox and providing a handle on quantum gravity, but those aren’t done yet – they are promises. Until such promises are realized, the theory could be accused of being a reinterpretation rather than an explanation. For instance, saying “gravity emerges from entropy” doesn’t immediately solve, say, the hierarchy problem or why gravity is so weak compared to other forces. It shifts the question to “why is there so much information associated with gravity and horizons?” which is essentially the same as the original question phrased differently. We have to be mindful of this and continue to refine the theory so that it yields independent insights.

- **Complexity of Defining “Information” in General Situations:** Information can mean different things – Shannon information, algorithmic information, Boltzmann entropy, entanglement entropy – and in a gravitational context, especially a general curved spacetime, it’s not always clear how to define the entropy of a region if no horizon is present. In a black hole, the event horizon provides a natural demarcation. In flat space with two masses, what surface or volume do we attribute entropy to? We have assumed it can be done (like choose an imaginary sphere around masses, etc.), but in general spacetimes which are dynamic, this could be ambiguous. Our model might need a more concrete rule (perhaps something like “use the holographic screens defined by equipotential surfaces or causal horizons”). Lacking a clear rule could be seen as a weakness because it leaves the theory less defined. Different choices might lead to different “information forces.” We’ve tried to avoid such arbitrariness by focusing on local relations (like using local acceleration and local entropy density), but the issue of how to count information in a general setting remains a bit fuzzy.

- **Compatibility with Local Lorentz Invariance and Causality:** Emergent theories sometimes face the issue of whether they secretly violate local symmetries. Our paradigm, since it is meant to reproduce Einstein’s equations, should inherit Lorentz invariance and general covariance at large scales. But if the true microstates are something like a fixed lattice of bits or a preferred frame for information flow, it could lead to small violations of Lorentz symmetry (perhaps detectable as, say, anisotropies in inertia or vacuum properties). We have not specified such details, but it’s a potential concern: any underlying information mechanism must either be fully Lorentz-invariant (which is tricky if it’s discrete) or the violations must be suppressed below observable levels. This is a limitation in the sense of a caution: as the paradigm is developed further, one must check that it doesn’t introduce subtle inconsistencies with the symmetry principles that are foundational in modern physics. Currently, by sticking to high-level principles like entropy = area, etc., we implicitly assumed those symmetries (since those formulae are generally covariant). But a future, more detailed model will have to be careful on this front.

- **Interpretational Challenges (Philosophical Considerations):** Finally, there is the fact that the theory is somewhat **interpretational** and could be seen as blurring the line between physical law and informational description. Some physicists might question whether “entropy” is truly the cause of gravity or just a calculational tool. Does the apple fall because it wants to maximize entropy, or is that just a way of calculating the motion which could equally be described by spacetime curvature? In physics, multiple descriptions are possible (think of principle of least action vs. Newton’s laws – they are different formalisms for the same outcomes). The information-centric paradigm claims to be more than just a different formalism; it claims a different ontology (that information is fundamental). While this is a strength in terms of potentially unifying physics with information science, it’s also a conceptual leap that some may view as a weakness until it’s absolutely necessary. It opens questions like “are laws of physics emergent from statistics of unknown micro-laws?” and “is the second law more fundamental than the first law or Newton’s laws?” These are thought-provoking, but they show that our theory is not a straightforward physical theory in the traditional sense – it is bridging into philosophy of physics territory. As such, it will likely be met with healthy skepticism and will need a robust defense and evidence to be accepted.

Despite these limitations, it is worth emphasizing that they also mark **opportunities** for future research. Each gap or weakness points to a direction where the theory can be improved or fleshed out: defining the microscopic bits of spacetime, formulating the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime, making contact with quantum information theory, and so forth. Addressing these will be crucial for the long-term viability of the paradigm.

## Conclusion  
We have presented a comprehensive review and refinement of the idea that gravity and time are emergent phenomena rooted in information theory – an **information-centric paradigm** of fundamental physics. The core concept is that spacetime (with its curvature that manifests as gravity) and the flow of time (with its arrow pointing from past to future) both originate from the tendencies and constraints of information and entropy in the universe. We examined the mathematical consistency of this idea, demonstrating that it can be made compatible with established laws: Newton’s law of gravitation and Einstein’s field equations can be derived from informational principles under the right conditions ([[1001.0785] On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785#:~:text=of%20gravitation%20is%20shown%20to,inertia%20whose%20origin%20is%20entropic)) ([[gr-qc/9504004] Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004#:~:text=,This)). In doing so, we ensured that key equations incorporate the necessary physical constants and relationships (such as the Unruh temperature and Bekenstein’s entropy bound) so that our emergent picture reproduces the measurable reality of gravity.

Comparing our framework to general relativity, we find that while GR remains a supremely accurate macroscopic theory, the information-centric view offers a different interpretative lens – one that potentially unifies gravity with thermodynamics and quantum information. Unlike GR, where time is a fundamental coordinate and the existence of an arrow must be assumed as an initial condition (e.g., low entropy at the Big Bang), our approach gives a natural origin to time’s arrow as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics ([Arrow of time - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time#:~:text=,has%20no%20analogue%20in%20space)). We also saw how our paradigm stands apart from earlier proposals in the literature: it builds on Bekenstein’s and Hawking’s insights by generalizing the gravity–entropy connection beyond black holes, it extends Verlinde’s entropic gravity by addressing dynamic scenarios and clarifying the role of time and locality, and it embodies Wheeler’s philosophical *“it from bit”* in a testable scientific form ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Wheeler%20has%20condensed%20these%20ideas,no%20questions%2C%20binary%20choices%2C%20bits.%E2%80%9D)).

We discussed possible ways to verify (or falsify) this paradigm. In the near term, its consistency with all classical tests of gravity is a must; in the longer term, subtle deviations might be detectable in regimes not yet fully probed, such as the behavior of gravity on galactic scales or the details of black hole evaporation. The paradigm suggests that phenomena usually ascribed to dark matter and dark energy might be explainable via emergent gravity and information distribution ([Quantum information and its relativity to the universe](https://independentaustralia.net/environment/environment-display/quantum-information-and-its-relativity-to-the-universe,15878#:~:text=Erik%20Verlinde%20further%20theorised%20that,parts%20of%20the%20string%20theory)) – a bold claim that will require extensive observational scrutiny. We also highlighted that if this view is correct, then information should never be lost (resolving the black hole information paradox) and that there is an equivalence of information and energy that could, in principle, be subjected to experiment. These serve as focal points for future empirical and theoretical exploration.

In acknowledging the **limitations** of our theory, we have been candid about its current stage of development. Key open questions include identifying the microscopic carriers of gravitational information, extending the formalism to non-equilibrium processes, and integrating it fully with quantum mechanics. The answers to these questions will determine whether the information-centric paradigm remains a descriptive analogy or evolves into a fundamental theory of physics. It is our hope that by articulating the theory’s promises and pitfalls clearly, we encourage experts to rigorously examine, challenge, and refine the ideas. If the paradigm is on the right track, further work might reveal a deep and beautiful connection between information theory and the geometry of the universe, possibly shedding light on the elusive unification of quantum mechanics and gravity. If the paradigm is flawed, such critical examination will be invaluable in illuminating why, thereby deepening our understanding of the foundations of physics in either case.

In conclusion, *Information-Centric Gravity and Time* is an attractive paradigm not only because it provides an alluring conceptual unification – weaving together threads from thermodynamics, quantum theory, and relativity – but also because it drives us to ask new questions about old mysteries (What is entropy physically? Why does time have a direction? Is gravity an equation of state?). It reframes gravity from being an innate property of mass and spacetime to being an emergent force born from the “information bookkeeping” of the universe. This refined viewpoint remains consistent with known physics yet opens the door to novel insights. While much work remains to transform this paradigm into a fully quantitative, widely accepted theory, the effort is worthwhile. By exploring these ideas, we push the boundaries of our understanding and move closer to what Wheeler envisaged: a simple, compelling principle underlying existence ([Physicist John Wheeler and the “It from Bit” — John Horgan (The Science Writer)](https://johnhorgan.org/cross-check/physicist-john-wheeler-and-the-it-from-bit#:~:text=Wheeler%20jumps%20up%20and%20pulls,%E2%80%9D)). Perhaps that principle is that **information is reality**, and gravity and time are the natural languages that information speaks in our universe.
